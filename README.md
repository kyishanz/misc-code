# hello!

This repository is a collection of code snippets that I find especially meaningful or fun. They're organized by file-name, and do not include the entire library system for PROS / VexCode for ease of presentation. The folders "src" and "subsystemHeaders" have the autonomous routine codes in full context. 

*Thank you* for visiting! \(^o^)/~
